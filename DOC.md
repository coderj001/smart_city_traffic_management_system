### Story Overview:

Imagine a bustling, modern city facing challenges with traffic congestion and road safety. The city's government decides to implement an advanced traffic management system to optimize traffic flow, reduce congestion, and enhance road safety. They've tasked you with developing the backend API for this system using Go and Gin, integrating real-time traffic data from a network of sensors spread across the city.

#### Key Features and Endpoints:

1. **Sensor Data Management**:
   - **Endpoint**: `/sensors`
     - **GET**: Retrieve information on all sensors (location, status).
     - **POST**: Register a new traffic sensor.
   - **Endpoint**: `/sensor/{id}`
     - **GET**: Retrieve data from a specific sensor.
     - **PUT**: Update sensor details.
     - **DELETE**: Deactivate a sensor.

2. **Real-time Traffic Data**:
   - **Endpoint**: `/traffic`
     - **GET**: Get real-time traffic data citywide, including vehicle counts and average speeds.

3. **Incident Reporting and Management**:
   - **Endpoint**: `/incidents`
     - **GET**: List all reported traffic incidents.
     - **POST**: Report a new traffic incident (e.g., accidents, roadblocks).
   - **Endpoint**: `/incident/{id}`
     - **PUT**: Update the status of an incident (e.g., resolved, ongoing).

4. **Traffic Analysis and Statistics**:
   - **Endpoint**: `/statistics`
     - **GET**: Retrieve traffic statistics, such as peak hours, high congestion areas, and incident frequency.

5. **User Management for City Officials**:
   - **Endpoint**: `/officials`
     - **GET**: List all registered city officials.
     - **POST**: Add a new city official account.
   - **Endpoint**: `/official/{id}`
     - **PUT**: Update official's details.
     - **DELETE**: Remove official's access.

6. **Public Notifications and Alerts**:
   - **Endpoint**: `/alerts`
     - **GET**: Publicly accessible traffic alerts and recommendations (e.g., road closures, rerouting).

#### Additional Features:

- **Real-time Data Simulation**: Simulate sensor data to reflect real-time traffic conditions.
- **Redis Caching**: Implement caching for high-demand endpoints like `/traffic` and `/incidents`.
- **Swagger Documentation**: Use Swagger to document all your API endpoints.
- **Docker Deployment**: Containerize your application and its dependencies (Redis, PostgreSQL) for easy deployment.
- **End-to-End Testing**: Thoroughly test each endpoint, ensuring data accuracy and system reliability.

### Storyline:

Your task is to bring this system to life, enabling the city to dynamically manage its traffic. The system should be capable of providing real-time insights, responding to changing traffic conditions, and aiding in decision-making to alleviate traffic issues. City officials will use this system to monitor traffic patterns, respond to incidents, and plan infrastructure improvements. The public will also benefit from real-time traffic alerts and recommendations.

By completing this challenge, you will demonstrate your ability to build a complex, real-world backend system using Go, showcasing your skills in API development, database management, caching, and software testing.
