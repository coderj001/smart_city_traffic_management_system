### Coding Challenge: Smart City Traffic Management System

#### Brief:
Develop a backend API for a simulated Smart City Traffic Management System. This system should use real-time data to monitor and manage city traffic flow.

#### Key Components:

1. **Traffic Sensor Simulation**:
   - Each sensor has properties like location (latitude, longitude), data output rate (seconds), and status (active/inactive).
   - Sensors provide data such as vehicle count, average speed, and incident reports (e.g., accidents or roadblocks).

2. **Data Management**:
   - Implement a PostgreSQL database to store sensor data, traffic alerts, and historical traffic patterns.
   - Design an efficient schema that can handle high-frequency data updates and queries.

3. **API Development**:
   - Develop a RESTful API using Go.
   - Implement endpoints for real-time traffic data, historical data retrieval, sensor status updates, and incident reporting.

4. **Redis Caching**:
   - Use Redis for caching frequent API requests, such as current traffic conditions or recent incidents, to enhance performance.
   - Cache should be configurable and refresh at a regular interval.

5. **Docker Integration**:
   - Create Dockerfiles and a Docker Compose setup to containerize the Go application, PostgreSQL, and Redis.
   - Ensure the system can be easily started with minimal setup commands.

6. **API Documentation and Testing**:
   - Document the API using Swagger or a similar tool.
   - Write end-to-end tests covering all aspects of the system, ensuring data accuracy and API reliability.

7. **Real-Time Data Simulation and Analysis**:
   - Simulate real-time traffic data for a hypothetical city grid.
   - Implement logic for data analysis, like detecting high-traffic zones, peak times, and potential incidents.

8. **Advanced Features**:
   - Include features like dynamic traffic alerts based on sensor data (e.g., rerouting suggestions during high traffic or incidents).
   - Implement an admin interface for traffic authorities to update sensor status or broadcast city-wide traffic notifications.

#### Real-Life Application:
This system mimics a real-world Smart City traffic management scenario, where handling large volumes of data efficiently and providing real-time insights is crucial. It combines backend development with IoT (Internet of Things) data simulation and real-time data processing, making it a comprehensive challenge for modern full-stack development skills.

#### Skills Tested:
- Backend Development (Golang)
- API Design and Documentation
- Database Schema Design and Management (PostgreSQL)
- Real-Time Data Processing and Caching (Redis)
- Docker Containerization and Orchestration
- End-to-End Testing and Simulation Logic

This challenge offers a hands-on experience in developing a system that could be part of a larger Smart City infrastructure, testing a developer's ability to handle large-scale, real-time data processing and management tasks.
