Traffic System Development Plan

Project Initialization and Setup

Goal: Set up the basic project structure and tools.

    Create a Go module: go mod init traffic-system.
    Set up version control: Initialize a Git repository with .gitignore for Go.

Database Schema Design

Goal: Design a database schema to store sensor data, traffic alerts, and historical patterns.

    Define tables and relationships: Create tables for sensors, traffic data, incidents, etc., with relationships (e.g., foreign keys).
    Normalization: Ensure efficient data organization, minimizing redundancy and ensuring data integrity.

API Design and Endpoint Planning

Goal: Outline the RESTful API structure and plan endpoints.

    Define endpoint paths and methods: For example, GET /sensors for sensor data retrieval, POST /incidents for incident reporting.
    Determine request and response formats: Decide on JSON structures for inputs and outputs.

Sensor Data Simulation

Goal: Develop a system to simulate sensor data.

    Random data generation: Write functions to generate mock data for vehicle count, speed, and incidents.
    Output rate control: Implement mechanisms to simulate data generation at varying intervals.

PostgreSQL Database Integration

Goal: Set up and integrate PostgreSQL database.

    Install PostgreSQL: Use Docker or direct installation.
    Connect from Go: Utilize libraries like pq or pgx to connect and interact with the database.

Redis Setup for Caching

Goal: Implement Redis for caching frequently accessed data.

    Install Redis: Set it up locally or via Docker.
    Integrate Redis in Go: Use a Go Redis client to cache and retrieve data.

API Development

Goal: Develop the RESTful API using Go and Gin.

    Implement handlers: Write functions to handle API requests and interact with the database.
    Routing: Set up routes in Gin to map endpoints to handlers.

Dockerization of the Application

Goal: Containerize the Go application, PostgreSQL, and Redis.

    Write Dockerfiles: Create Dockerfiles for the application and databases.
    Compose with Docker Compose: Define the multi-container setup.

API Documentation

Goal: Document the API using Swagger or similar tools.

    Swagger setup: Integrate Swagger for auto-generating API documentation.
    Document endpoints: Ensure all endpoints are well documented, including request and response examples.

Testing

Goal: Write and perform tests to ensure system reliability.

    Unit testing: Test individual components and functions.
    End-to-end testing: Test the entire flow, from API requests to database interactions.

Advanced Features and User Interface

Goal: Implement advanced features and admin interface.

    Traffic analysis logic: Develop algorithms to analyze traffic data.
    Admin interface: Build a basic UI for traffic authorities to interact with the system.

Performance Optimization and Security

Goal: Enhance system performance and security.

    Profile the application: Identify and optimize performance bottlenecks.
    Secure the API: Implement authentication and authorization.

Deployment and Monitoring

Goal: Deploy the application and set up monitoring.

    CI/CD setup: Automate deployment processes.
    Monitoring tools: Use tools to monitor application health and performance.
